- Focus on storyline and page goals only.

Hard rules:
- {slide_rule}
- Output one valid JSON object only.
- The JSON must contain a single key named `pages`.
- Each page item must contain only: `page_no`, `title`, `goal`.
- Do not write body content.
- Do not write HTML.
- Do not write CSS.
- Do not write Python code.
- Do not write Markdown code fences.
- Use {language}.
- Keep tone professional, concise, and conclusion-led.

Quality rules:

- The last page should converge to recommendation, roadmap, or conclusion.
- Avoid vague titles like "Background", "Analysis", or "Future Outlook" unless they carry a specific business point.
